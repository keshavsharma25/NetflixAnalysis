# Netflix Analysis- Introduction to Data Visualization using Plotly

<hr>

## Introduction

This repository is a simple introduction to Plotly, Pandas and Recommendation System.

The dataset used to create this notebook is [Netflix TV Shows and Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies). 

I have also created a Kaggle notebook so that one can see the notebook in a more organized and interactive way. The link to the notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/keshavsharma25/data-visualization-using-plotly-with-netflix-data). I also created a UI interface for the Recommendation System using Streamlit and the link to the same is [https://netflix-recommends.herokuapp.com/](https://netflix-recommends.herokuapp.com/).
