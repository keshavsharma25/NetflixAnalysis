# Netflix Analysis- Introduction to Data Visualization using Plotly

<hr>

## Introduction

This repository is a simple introduction to Plotly and Pandas. One can learn how to use Plotly and Pandas to create interactive charts and visualizations.

The dataset used to create this notebook is [Netflix TV Shows and Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies). The link to the preview of the notebook is [here](https://netflix-analysis-plotly.netlify.app/analysis.html).

I have also created a Kaggle notebook so that you can see the data in a more organized and interactive way. The link to the notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/keshavsharma25/data-visualization-using-plotly-with-netflix-data).

If you like the notebook please give it an upvote and let me know if I can improve this in anyway.

### Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the dependencies on either your command line or your notebook cell:

```python
pip install plotly
pip install pandas
```
